## Description
This web application is composed of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to render a weather dashboard using API's. Starting with CSS, the application has been styled to display closely to the sample image given in the repository along with media queries to display differently with different screen sizes.  Moving onto JavaScript, the OpenWeather API Key has been called for multiple different occasions including: getting geographical coordinates to display weather in the particular city and displaying five days of future forecasts. There have been icons imported for a visual representation of the weather.

## Usage

When the user accesses the deployed application, there will not be a displayed forecast at first. Once the user searches for a location, the OpenWeather API grabs the longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates for that location and displays the current and future weather for that specific location. When the user selects to use the current location, it grabs the coordinates of the users location and displays the weather for that particular location. The user is able to access the application using different screen sizes and browsers. 

When the user accesses the code, they are able to see semantic HTML and CSS elements with comments throughout which help guide throughout the documentation.
